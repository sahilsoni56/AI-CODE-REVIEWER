"```javascript\nfunction sum(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe original code snippet `function sum(){return a+b;}` has a couple of issues:\n\n1. **Missing Parameters:** The function `sum` is declared without any input parameters.  This means the function doesn't know what values `a` and `b` are supposed to represent.  JavaScript will treat `a` and `b` as undefined variables within the function's scope.\n\n2. **Assumed Global Variables (Potentially):**  If `a` and `b` are not defined within the function and are not passed as parameters, JavaScript will look for them in the global scope. If they don't exist there, the function will return `NaN` (Not a Number) because you're trying to add undefined values.\n\n**The corrected code addresses these issues:**\n\n* **Explicit Parameters:**  `function sum(a, b)`  defines `a` and `b` as parameters that the function expects when it's called.  This means you need to provide values for `a` and `b` when you call the function, like this: `sum(5, 3);`\n\n* **Clear Function Definition:** This version makes it clear that the function's purpose is to add the two values passed to it as `a` and `b` and return the result.\n\n**How to use the corrected code:**\n\n```javascript\nfunction sum(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nlet result = sum(5, 3);  // result will be 8\nconsole.log(result);       // Output: 8\n\nlet anotherResult = sum(10, -2); // anotherResult will be 8\nconsole.log(anotherResult);      // Output: 8\n```
